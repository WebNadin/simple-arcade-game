 There is an area with generation field and several tools for changing different indicators.
 After loading page we see figures, that falls down. New figure are randomly generated and creating every 500ms. Every
 figure has random color and random shape(one of 7 standard shapes).
 You can "kill" the figure clicking on her.
 All figures falls with the same speed. You can change it by increase/decrease buttons. Current gravity is displayed
 on the appropriate field.
 We calculate the area of ​​some figures. So you can see the value for just-generated figure on the top of generation
 area in the appropriate field.

 In this project I mastered:
 - PIXI.js
 - creation of different shapes using PIXI.Graphics
